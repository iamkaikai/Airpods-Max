*description*
I tried to replicate Apple's website.

## What Worked Well
Flex is really powerful for repsonsive web and layout

## What Didn't
The video, tabs, and interation needs JS to run. Cannot be done with pure CSS. Using vw/vh or % as the size of element might work in one viewport, but it get messy pretty quickly when we switch to different sizes. Sometimes, absolute unit works better than relative unit.
